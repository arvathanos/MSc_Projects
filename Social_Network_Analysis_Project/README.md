# Social Network Analysis Project
Here by using MATLAB we tried to analyze and find insights about a paper co-authorship network. We managed to develop a neural network that help us find out the best metric available to achieve our goals.
The data we used were taken from: sx-stackoverflow.txt as consecutive
triplets of the form (source id,target id,timestamp).
